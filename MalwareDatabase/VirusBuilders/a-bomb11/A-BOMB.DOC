                         Ansi Bomb Kit v1.1 Docs

   Kay, here's my rules: In exchange for use of my decent program here, I
ask that you distribute it as much as you possibly can. If you don't, well,
as I say, what can I do. 

   Another thing, I'm not like alot of programers. If you can figure out how
to edit my program, go ahead. All I want you ta do is leave the the opening
screens the way they are. AND MOST IMPORTATLY, if you manage to somehow screw
up a PC or anything of that sort with the Ansi Bomb Kit, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE!
It was your choice to download it, to use it, to give out the bombs, SO AGAIN,
I AM NOT BLOODY RESPONSIBLE! That's `bout it.
